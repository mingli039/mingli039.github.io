title: Block Assault Updates
---

Block Assault is now repriced to $0.99 on the Chrome Web Store, for both the [Chome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-assault/aondpffpdeihimpgfjobgiacbmmnkdbn) and the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-assault/jjfmmiliefbfpjldoghbgajndhaldmed). Block Assault costs now only 25% of what it was previously. To make things sweeter, Block Assault is free to play on [Itch.io](https://samleedevelops.itch.io/block-assault) â€” with internet connection of course. Once purchased, both the Chrome App & Extension can be played without an internet connection. Personally, I would say that the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-assault/jjfmmiliefbfpjldoghbgajndhaldmed) is the best deal, mainly because tthe JavaScript to the application can be modified.
