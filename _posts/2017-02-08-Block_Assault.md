title:  A New Web Application - Block Assault
---
[Block Assault](https://blockassault.github.io) was developed throughout the months of December and January. [Block Assault](https://blockassault.github.io) is a small web game; it uses virtual warfare in the form of (as the name would suggest) squares.

Mobile version [here](https://blockassault.github.io/mobile) (Note: the mobile version will not work well a desktop computer).
