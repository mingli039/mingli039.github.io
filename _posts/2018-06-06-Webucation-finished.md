title: Webucation Officially Closing
---

Thank you to all who supported Webucation. Webucation was a two-year project meant for educational purposes. Webucation, as a project, is finished, and has served its purpose. Though Webucation is shutting down, for good this time, we as developers will continue onto to other projects. Stay tuned for more updates. Webucation was a great journey, and frankly, it's time for that journey to end.
