title:  Webucation - A New Beginning?
---
Almost a year ago, Webucation as a whole was shutdown completely, and ultimately forever vanished from the internet entirely. After a persuasive urge from people around the world, I now announce the revival of Webucation. Webucation is now live at (webucation.site)[http://webucation.site].

Throughout the past year, immediately after I took down Webucation, I continued developing the site in secret. I sought after local, and abroad professionals asking them to review Webucation. To my disbelief, almost all of them answered my prompt with tremendous genuine; most of them gave a full overview of Webucation. Since then, I have took their feedback and amplified it through the development of Webucation. Webucation is now fully updated, see for yourself (here)[http://webucation.site].
