title:  Webucation has launched!
---
After a bit of time through development; over the course of November to May, Webucation is ready to be launched. Webucation is a website that teaches and develops the fundamentals of the universal programming languages of the web. HTML5, CSS3, and even JavaScript.

UPDATE: The link to the site is no longer available due to the developer taking the site down entirely.
