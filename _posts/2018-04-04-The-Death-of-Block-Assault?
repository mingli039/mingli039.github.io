title: The Death of Block Assault?
---

Due to certain reasons, of which, we are not at the liberty to discuss at the moment, Block Assault (the GitHub version) has been taken down.

Please note that Block Assault on [Webucation](http://webucation.site) will also be taken down shortly.

Thank you for your cooperation.
